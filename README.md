# Machine Learning Models Repository

This repository contains a variety of machine learning models implemented as Jupyter Notebooks. These models are used across my personal projects. Each model is organized in its own directory, containing the notebook, the dataset, and a README file describing the model and its usage.

## Model List

Here is a list of the machine learning models available in this repository:

| Model Name | Associated Project(s) |
|------------|--------------------|
| NER using CRF| Resume Parser [coming soon]|

## How to Use

Each model directory contains a Jupyter Notebook and a dataset folder. To use a specific model, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the model's directory (`model_1/`, `model_2/`, etc.).
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`model_1_notebook.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the instructions and comments in the notebook to understand the model's implementation, training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (install using `pip install jupyter`)

Additionally, some models might have specific library requirements. These requirements will be mentioned in the individual model README files.
